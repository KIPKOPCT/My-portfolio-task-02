            1. Deposit Requirement To begin any design project, a  60% deposit of the total project  cost is required. This deposit secures your project in our schedule and allows us to commence  work. The remaining balance is  due upon project completion and before nal les are delivered
          </p>
          <p>
                2.Clients also have the option to make 
                full payment at the start of the project if preferred. Full payment upfront 
                can help expedite the process, as it 
                allows for immediate commencement and completion without additional payment steps
          </p>
          <p>
                3. Non-Refundable Deposit
                Once the project has started, the 
                60% deposit becomes non-refundable, as resources and time 
                will have been allocated to the 
                project.
          </p>
          <p>
                4.Payment Methods and Confirmation
                Accepted payment methods include [list of payment methods 
                here, e.g., bank transfer, credit 
                card, PayPal]. Payment conrmation is required before any project work begins

            <p>
                1. Final Payment Deadline
                The nal payment for the design 
                project is due within one (1) 
                month from the project completion date. Prompt payment is necessary to avoid any additional 
                fees
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Late Payment Policy
                If the nal payment is not received 
                within the one-month period, additional charges will apply. Late payments will incur an added fee 
                beyond the original project cost, 
                which will cover administrative and 
                handling costs associated with delayed payment
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Revised Payment Amount
                The total amount due after one 
                month will include the original 
                project price plus the applicable 
                late fee. The client will be informed of the updated amount, 
                which must be paid in full to receive nal project les or continue services

          <p>
                1. Refund Eligibility
                A full refund is available only if 
                the client requests it before the 
                design project has begun. This 
                ensures that the client can 
                change their mind at the start 
                without any nancial commitment
        </p>
          <p>
                2. No Refunds After 
                Project Start
                Once the design project has begun, no refunds will be issued. This policy applies as 
                work and resources have already been allocated to the project. By approving the 
                start of the project, the client agrees to 
                the non-refundable nature of these services
        </p>
          <p>
                3. Project Start Denition
                A project is considered "started" 
                once initial design concepts, research, or planning work has 
                commenced following the client’s 
                conrmation and payment
        </p>
          <p>
                4. Exceptional Cases
                In cases of unforeseen circumstances, we may, at our discretion, oer a partial refund depending on the project stage and 
                work completed. Any such refunds will be reviewed and provided solely at our discretion

            1. File Retention Period
            Final design les, such as PSD or 
            AI les, will be stored for a period 
            of one (1) month from the date of 
            nal project delivery. Clients are 
            encouraged to download and securely store their les within this 
            period
          </p>
          <p>
                2. Extended File Storage
                If you wish to have us retain your 
                les beyond the initial one-month 
                period, a monthly storage fee will 
                apply. This extended storage service 
                ensures that your les are securely 
                backed up and accessible upon request for as long as the subscription 
                remains active
          </p>
          <p>
                3. File Deletion Policy
                After the one-month retention 
                period, les will be permanently 
                deleted if no storage subscription 
                has been activated. Once deleted, 
                these les cannot be retrieved

                1. Provision of Information
                Clients must provide all required 
                information, content, and materials (e.g., logos, brand guidelines, 
                text, or images) necessary to 
                complete the design project. 
                Delays in providing this information may impact the project timeline
        </p>
          <p>
                2. Timely Feedback
                Clients are expected to provide clear 
                and timely feedback at each stage of 
                the design process. Feedback should 
                be communicated within 48 hours of 
                receiving drafts or revisions to 
                ensure project timelines are met.
        </p>
          <p>
                3. Point of Contact
                Clients must designate a single 
                point of contact to streamline 
                communication. This individual 
                will be responsible for consolidating feedback and approvals on 
                behalf of the client
        </p>
          <p>
                4. Approval Process
                Clients are responsible for reviewing all deliverables carefully. Once 
                a design is approved, any further 
                changes may incur additional 
                charges as per our revision policy
